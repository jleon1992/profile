	<h2 class="title">This is my first article</h2>
	<p class="first">So I am on day 3 of no fapping and no cigarettes and thought that now would be a good time to set some clearly defined goals for myself. After all a space ship with no direction no matter how awesome the space ship is will get lost in space, just saying. And this is not my first time trying to improve myself but again without clearly defined goals it is easy to slip up into idealized thinking rather than doing and sticking to it. What I mean is you can have all the positive thoughts in the world but if it doesn’t match your actions then you are just a daydreamer.</p>
	<p>Recently, well just like ten minutes ago I listened to a Jordan Peterson lecture, a Canadian psychologist whose work has gone viral recently for those of you who don’t know. His views on self-improvement have proven to be more practical and more substantial than some of the new age advice out there, not that there is anything wrong with that advice, it has actually helped me out tremendously as well. In this lecture he stated the importance of cleaning up your room because it is an extension of the Self. For me this definitely extends to my computer and being able to clearly articulate truth about the thoughts inside my head. For a while now I have used avoiding and escapism habits to avoid the things right in front of me hoping for it to fix itself. I know I said I was going to set goals but I needed to get a chance to clear out these mental cobwebs which have been accumulating in my mind for quite some time.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Goal 1: Write a blog post everyday to measure progress and noticeable changes for everyday on my NoFap Journey.</li>
		<li>Goal 2: Post the blog on my website</li>
		<li>Goal 3: Spend at least 2 hours a day learning new things about coding until I get a job as a developer</li>
		<li>Goal 4: Make it to day 90 on Nofap</li>
		<li>Goal 5: Take medication as prescribed</li>
		<li>Goal 6: Take care of health by working out for at least 10 minutes a day</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I want to use this as an opportunity to describe what is was exactly that I went through and was experiencing leading up to my visit in the psych ward because it has been haunting my thoughts since. Part of me misses the insanity because I felt so special in a unique kind of way. Now I know that I am special in a unique way but really know it, like I feel it, the Love, the drive, the ambition, the energy, but let me not be so sporadic. I’ll have to get back to this tomorrow because I have to work on my website and learning more programming. Till next time…  </p>
